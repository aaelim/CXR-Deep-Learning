# CXR-Deep-Learning

CXR Deep Learning Project.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook. To run, all files need to be included in the relevant folders, all libraries need to be installed, and the Kaggle dataset (not included) from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashery/chexpert needs to be downloaded. Generated files are not included but can be acquired by running all the code.
